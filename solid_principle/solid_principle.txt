The SOLID principles are a set of design principles that help in designing and organizing software code to achieve maintainability, extensibility, and reusability. These principles were introduced by Robert C. Martin (also known as Uncle Bob) and are widely recognized as best practices in software development. SOLID is an acronym where each letter corresponds to a specific principle:

1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):
	- A class should have only one reason to change.
	- Each class should have a single responsibility or purpose.
	- It promotes high cohesion and reduces coupling between classes.
	- Breaking down complex functionality into smaller, focused classes makes code easier to 		  understand, test, and maintain.


2. Open-Closed Principle (OCP):
	- Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but 		  closed for modification.
	- Existing code should not be modified to add new functionality.
	- New features should be implemented by adding new code, not by changing existing code.
	- This principle promotes code reuse, scalability, and minimizes the risk of introducing 		  bugs in existing code.


3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):
	- Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without affecting the correctness of 		  the program.
	- Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without causing 	  errors or unexpected behavior.
	- It ensures that inheritance hierarchies are well-designed and adhere to the "is-a" 	  relationship.
	- Violating this principle can lead to incorrect program behavior and violated expectations.



4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):
	- Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
	- It states that a class should not have to implement interfaces that contain methods they 	  don't need.
	- Interface segregation promotes the creation of smaller, cohesive interfaces tailored to 	  specific client needs.
	- This principle helps in avoiding bloated interfaces and minimizing coupling between 	  components.


5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):
	- High-level modules/classes should not depend on low-level modules/classes. Both should depend 	  on abstractions.
	- Abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions.
	- It promotes loose coupling and allows for decoupling of modules, making code more flexible 	  and maintainable.
	- Dependency injection and inversion of control (IoC) containers are commonly used techniques 	  to implement this principle.
